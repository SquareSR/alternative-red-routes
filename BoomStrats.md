Leave the gym and re-enter.

| ------------------- | --------------------------------------    
| 1-24               | Play Normal.
| 25-26              | **Rhyhorn**: Elixer + Blizz or EQ, then play normal.
| 27-31*             | **Rhyhorn**: Blizz (+EQ);  **Nidoking**: X-Spec or X-Spd Turn 1 (+Elixer) (+TB), **EQ at any time if hit**;  **Rhydon**: (Elixer) + Blizz
| 32+		             | **Rhyhorn**: Blizz / EQ;  Nidoking: Elixer Turn 1, (+X-Spec/X-Spd) (+TB), **EQ at any time if hit**

> With 27+ HP after Blackbelt, be prepared to know what to do if you miss Blizzard on Gio's Rhyhorn.   
> (1) If Rhyhorn **hits you or lands a tail whip**, always Elixer right away (if you didn't already before the fight).
> (2) Otherwise, EQx3 and Elixer turn 1 on Nidoking even if this risks being KO'd by thrash.
